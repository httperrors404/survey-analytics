## Building survey-analytics from sources

To build library yourself:

1.  **Clone the repo from GitHub**

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/surveyjs/survey-analytics.git
    cd survey-analytics
    ```

2.  **Acquire build dependencies.** Make sure you have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) installed on your workstation. You need a version of Node.js greater than 6.0.0 and npm greater than 2.7.0. This is only needed to _build_ surveyjs from sources.

    ```
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Build the library**

    ```
    npm run build_prod
    ```

    After that you should have the library at 'packages' directory.

4.  **Run samples**

    ```
    npm start
    ```

    This command will run local http server at the http://localhost:7777

    You can open http://localhost:7777/examples/examples

5.  **Run unit tests**
    ```
    npm test
    ```
    This command will run unit tests

## Nearest plans (Nov 2020 - Dec 2020)

Our task list of Survey Analytics pack:

- Make it easy to integrate/replace new (custom) visualizers
- Implement data providing server side prototype
- Introduce (or use 3rd party) data processing engine for survey analytics
- Support high load scenario - process at least billion records

## Limitations

- SurveyJS Analytics doesn't support objects as values (e.g. of dropdown, radiogroup and other select question items)
- WordCloud visualizer is too slow for large texts and significant answers count
